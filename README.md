# I'm not really sure why you're here.

No, seriously, *why* are you here?

Anyway, since you're here, I might as well explain myself.

This is my stash of personal tutorials, projects, scripts, even my own personal notes as I go through self-learning Python.
If you actually click some of these and read through the source code, you might notice that I leave comments _a LOT_ .
I do this not only to help explain to myself and reinforce what the code is doing in plain-text, but, I also think i'm funny.

I'm not.


Anyways, I've gone through trying to self-teach various different programming languages, from HTML to Swift, but i've come to
rest my laurels in Python.

I've found more often than not, (maybe i'm just slow) that the technical explanations for code can be pretty arcane/high-level, and
that's pretty difficult for newbies to understand if they're just starting out and don't exactly know the differences 
between methods and functions are. 

I've chosen to start publishing my personal notes up here because not only have i filled probably 4-5 notebooks already 
and decided that i'm much too poor to keep wasting trees like that, but, if someone manages to lose their way in looking
for resources for help, if my psychotic notes and *dumb* comment explanations help at least *one* person, then it's worth it.

As the late, great, _Yoda_ once said:

# Do, or do not - there is no *try*.
